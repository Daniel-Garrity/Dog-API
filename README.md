# Dog Website

A fun little side project where I’m experimenting with APIs and JavaScript!

## Overview
This app fetches random dog images from the [Dog CEO API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) and displays them on the page. You can also select a specific dog breed from a dropdown to see images of that breed. Each image comes with a fun random dog fact.

## Features
- Fetch random dog images.
- Select dog breed from a dropdown to see images of that breed.
- See a new random dog fact with each image.
- Works in any browser.

## How to Use
1. Click **“Random Breed”** to reveal the breed dropdown.
2. Pick a dog breed from the list (or leave it on Random).
3. Click **“New Dog”** to see a new dog image and fact.
4. 
## Purpose
This project is a small experiment to practice working with APIs.
